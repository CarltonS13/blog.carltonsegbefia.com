## Welcome to my Unamed Blog

*This Unamed Blog* is a new blog about space, distant galaxies and black holes.

We'll talk about [the holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), dark matter and the beauty of space in infrared light.

This blog is run by **Carlton** and **God**.
