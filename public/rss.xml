One of the many words in the background was &#x201C;madam&#x201D;, a nickname for my mum I realized
    was a palindrome. Now I knew of palindromes, words that are spelled the same forwards and backward, but I didn&#x2019;t realize how many exist in the words I use. The other thing that struck me is when coupled with a geometric font, the symmetry of
    palindromes really shines and you can make some interesting designs out of them.</p>]]></description><link>https://blog.carltonsegbefia.com/geometric-font-+-palindrome</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.carltonsegbefia.com/geometric-font-+-palindrome</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
